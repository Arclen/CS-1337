A) Variable x is an int, not a pointer, so it cannot be assigned a memory location.
B) The statement should be 'ptr = &x;' because ptr has already been initialized as a pointer, having the '*' again is incorrect.
C) The statement should be 'cout << *(numbers + 3) << endl;' because otherwise it would print 13, since *numbers automatically returns the first value in the array, and the +3 would just add 3 to that value.
F) The statement should be '*iptr *= 2;' because we are changing the value the pointer points to, not the pointer itself.
I) The statement should be 'val *= 2' because val is not a pointer, so it can be directly manipulated.
M) This would return the address of wholeNum rather than the value of wholeNum.
